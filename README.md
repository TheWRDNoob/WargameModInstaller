## Wargame Mod Installer

The goal of this software is to provide Wargame modders with an easy, automated and safe way of distribution of their work. The general idea behind WMI is that it allows writing an installation script which is later executed by the application. Besides some basic features like files "copy-pasting", it also provides some dedicated functionality for direct data manipulation inside the game's asset files.
